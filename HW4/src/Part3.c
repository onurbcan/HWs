/*
 * Part3.c
 * Description: We want to make a machine to track the position of the enemy
 * camp. The machine should have an interface that is shown below:
 * The O is our position and it is constant. E represents the enemies’ current
 * position. X and Y is the current axes of the position of the enemy camp. R
 * shows the distance between current position and the last position of the
 * enemy camp. D is the distance of enemy to our camp. The machine should work
 * until the operator gives ‘E’ command to machine and it have to refresh the
 * view of screen on each ‘R’ command. The prototype of the function of that
 * machine is shown below:
 *
 * void track_machine ()
 *
 * You have to refresh parameters by another function. The function prototype
 * is:
 *
 * void refresh_position (int *X, int Y*, double *D, double *R)
 *
 * The battlefield consists of 11x11 positions and our camps is on the position
 * (6, 6). Initial position of enemy is (0, 0) and next positions of the enemy
 * camp should be generated randomly.
